README
======

To create reproducible tests on
all platforms the binaries itself are stored in the repository. If it's
necessary to recreate them, run `make clean; make`.

Requirements
------------

The following programs are necessary to _rebuild_ the binaries. The test suite
works fine without them.

 * make
 * nasm
 * GNU ld with i386 and x86_64 emulation mode

README
======

To create reproducible tests on all platforms the binaries itself
are stored in the repository. If it's necessary to recreate them,
run `make clean; make`.

Requirements
------------

The following programs are necessary to _rebuild_ the binaries. The test suite
works fine without them.

 * make
 * nasm
 * GNU ld with i386 and x86_64 emulation mode
